# Decisions

Running log of non-obvious architectural choices, alternatives considered,
and why. Written for interview prep — every entry should be defensible
out loud.

## M0 — Project skeleton, config, logging, CI

### src-layout (`src/l2_pipeline/`) instead of a flat package at repo root

**Alternative:** flat layout (`l2_pipeline/` directly under repo root).

**Why:** with a flat layout, `pytest` can accidentally import the package
from the working directory even if it isn't installed, which masks packaging
bugs (missing `__init__.py`, bad `pyproject.toml` package config) until
someone tries to actually install and run the thing. src-layout forces an
editable install (`uv sync` → `pip install -e .` under the hood) before tests
can import anything, so packaging correctness is verified from commit 1
instead of discovered later.

### `book/`, `feeds/`, `sinks/` as separate top-level packages

**Why:** the spec requires the book engine to be pure (no I/O) so it's
unit-testable with synthetic message sequences. Putting it in its own
package with no dependency on `feeds/` or `sinks/` makes that constraint
mechanically checkable (an import of `aiohttp`/`websockets`/`pyarrow` inside
`book/` is a code-review red flag, not just a documented convention).

### Python pinned to 3.12, not the system 3.14

**Alternative:** develop against whatever Python is already installed
(3.14.6 on this machine).

**Why:** 3.12 is closer to what a production trading shop would actually
run (nobody runs bleeding-edge Python in prod), and has broader/safer wheel
availability for `pyarrow` and other C-extension-heavy dependencies today
than a Python version that shipped a few months ago. `pyproject.toml` pins
`requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"` so this is enforced by tooling, not just
documentation.

### `uv` for dependency management

**Alternative:** plain `pip` + `requirements.txt`, or Poetry.

**Why:** `uv` is fast, uses the standard `pyproject.toml` + PEP 735
dependency-groups format (no proprietary lockfile format like Poetry's),
and has become a de facto standard in the Python ecosystem quickly enough
that using it is itself a small positive signal about staying current with
tooling.

### CI wired up in M0 with no real logic yet

**Alternative:** defer CI until there's substantial code to test (e.g.
after M1's book engine).

**Why:** CI configuration issues (wrong Python version resolution, wrong
working directory, mismatched dependency groups) are much cheaper to debug
against an empty repo than against a repo with real logic in flight. Getting
"green from commit 1" also means every subsequent milestone is validated
automatically instead of retroactively.

### Config: YAML file parsed into frozen dataclasses, not a raw dict or Pydantic model

**Alternatives considered:**
- Raw `dict` passed around — rejected: no static typing, silent KeyErrors
  at arbitrary depth in the code instead of one validation point.
- Pydantic — rejected for now: it's a reasonable choice too, but the spec's
  "no heavy frameworks" preference and the fact that the validation surface
  here is small (a handful of fields, a couple of enums) means hand-rolled
  dataclass parsing with explicit error messages is simpler and has zero
  extra dependencies. Worth revisiting if the config grows a lot of
  conditional/nested structure later.

**Why frozen + slots:** config is loaded once at startup and never mutated;
`frozen=True` makes accidental mutation a `FrozenInstanceError` instead of a
silent bug, and `slots=True` is a free memory/attribute-typo win with no
downside for a value object like this.

**Validation strategy:** `load_config()` raises a single `ConfigError` with a
human-readable message for every failure mode (missing file, malformed YAML,
non-mapping root, missing required keys, empty exchange list, empty symbol
list, invalid enum value) rather than letting `KeyError`/`TypeError`/
`yaml.YAMLError` leak out. The goal: a broken config file should fail loudly
and specifically at startup, not three call frames deep at 2am.

### `overflow_policy` modeled as an enum now, real logic deferred to M5

**Why:** the backpressure policy for the book-engine → Parquet-sink queue
isn't implemented yet (that's M5, after profiling shows what actually
matters). But the config schema is fixed early because changing a config
*shape* later (e.g. going from a bare string to a structured field) would be
a breaking change for anyone with an existing config file. Using an
`enum.Enum` with one variant used (`drop_oldest`) and a second already
declared (`coalesce`) means M5 adds behavior, not schema.

### Logging: structured JSON via a custom `logging.Formatter`, not a third-party JSON logging library

**Alternative:** `python-json-logger` or similar.

**Why:** the actual requirement (structured logging of every resync/gap/
disconnect incident) only needs a formatter that emits one JSON object per
log line and lets call sites attach arbitrary structured fields via
`extra={"extra_fields": {...}}`. That's ~20 lines of stdlib `logging` code;
pulling in a dependency for it isn't justified yet. `format: "json" | other`
is config-driven so a human-readable formatter is available for local
dev/debugging without code changes.

### `app.py` in M0 only loads config + logging, no feed/book wiring

**Why:** M0 is scoped to "skeleton, config, logging, CI" — wiring in feed
clients or the book engine before they exist (M1+) would mean either dead
code or fake stubs pretending to do something they don't. `main()` today
proves the config-loading and logging plumbing works end-to-end; each later
milestone extends it with real behavior instead of replacing placeholders.
